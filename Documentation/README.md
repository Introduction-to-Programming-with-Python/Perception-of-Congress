- The folder [Documentation](/Documentation/) contains the repository documentation files and context about this project.
- The filde [Data.csv](/Data.csv) is the data source for this project.

## Statement

This [document](/Documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives
